        Current Song: Sublime - What I Got <br> <br>
        Early in the morning, risin' to the street  /  Light me up that cigarette, and I'll strap shoes on my feet <br>
        Got to find the reason, reason things went wrong  /  Got to find a reason why my money's all gone <br>
        I got a Dalmatian and I can still get high  /  I can play the guitar like a motherfuckin' riot <br>
        Well, life is too short, so love the one you got  /  'Cause you might get run over, or you might get shot <br>
        Never start no static, I just get it off my chest  /  Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest <br>
        Take a small example, take a tip from me  /  Take all of your money, give it all to charity <br>
        Love is what I got, it's within my reach  /  And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach <br>
        It all comes back to you, you're bound to get what you deserve <br>
        Try and test that, you're bound to get served <br>
        Loves what I got, don't start a riot  /  You'll feel it when the dance gets hot <br>
        Lovin' is what I got  /  I said, remember that  /  Lovin' is what I got /And remember that <br>
        Lovin' is what I got  /  I said, remember that  /  Lovin' is what I got  /  (I got, I got, I got) <br>
        Why I don't cry when my dog runs away  /  I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay <br>
        I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot  /  Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock <br>
        Fuckin' and fightin', it's all the same  /  Living with Louie Dog's the only way to stay sane <br>
        Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me  /  Lovin' is what I got  /  I said, remember that <br>
        Lovin' is what I got  /  And remember that  /  Lovin' is what I got  /  I said remember that <br>
        Lovin' is what I got  /  (I got, I got, I got) <br>

        Current Song: R.E.M.  - It’s the End of the World as We Know It (and I Feel Fine)<br> <br>
        That's great, it starts with an earthquake  /  Birds and snakes, and aeroplanes<br>
        And Lenny Bruce is not afraid  /  Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn<br>
        World serves its own needs  /  Don't mis-serve your own needs<br>
        Speed it up a notch, speed, grunt, no, strength  /  The ladder starts to clatter<br>
        With a fear of height, down, height  /  Wire in a fire, represent the seven games<br>
        And a government for hire and a combat site  /  Left her, wasn't coming in a hurry<br>
        With the Furies breathing down your neck<br>
        Team by team, reporters baffled, trumped, tethered, cropped<br>
        Look at that low plane, fine, then  /  Uh oh, overflow, population, common group<br>
        But it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself  /  World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed<br>
        Tell me with the Rapture and the reverent in the right, right<br>
        You vitriolic, patriotic, slam fight, bright light<br>
        Feeling pretty psyched  /  It's the end of the world as we know it<br>
        It's the end of the world as we know it  /  It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine<br>
        Six o'clock, T.V. hour, don't get caught in foreign tower  /  Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn<br>
        Lock him in uniform, book burning, bloodletting  /  Every motive escalate, automotive incinerate<br>
        Light a candle, light a motive, step down, step down  /  Watch your heel crush, crush, uh oh<br>
        This means no fear, cavalier, renegade and steering clear<br>
        A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies<br>
        Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives and I decline<br>
        It's the end of the world as we know it (I had some time alone)<br>
        It's the end of the world as we know it (I had some time alone)<br>
         It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine (time I had some time alone)<br>
        I feel fine (I feel fine)  /  It's the end of the world as we know it (time I had some time alone)<br>
        It's the end of the world as we know it (time I had some time alone)<br>
        It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine (time I had some time alone)<br>
        The other night I drifted nice continental drift divide  /  Mountains sit in a line, Leonard Bernstein<br>
        Leonid Brezhnev, Lenny Bruce and Lester Bangs  /  Birthday party, cheesecake, jellybean, boom<br>
        You symbiotic, patriotic, slam but neck, right, right<br>
        It's the end of the world as we know it (time I had some time alone)<br>
        It's the end of the world as we know it (time I had some time alone)<br>
        It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine (time I had some time alone)<br>
        It's the end of the world as we know it  /  It's the end of the world as we know it<br>

        Current Song:  Barenaked Ladies - One Week <br> <br>
        It's been one week since you looked at me  /  Cocked your head to the side and said, "I'm angry" <br>
        Five days since you laughed at me  /  Saying, "Get that together, come back and see me" <br>
        Three days since the living room  /  I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you <br>
        Yesterday, you'd forgiven me  /  But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry <br>
        Hold it now and watch the hoodwink  /  As I make you stop, think <br>
        You'll think you're looking at Aquaman  /  I summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss <br>
        I like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan  /  Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes <br>
        Big like LeAnn Rimes, because I'm all about value  /  Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits <br>
        You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through  /  Gonna make a break and take a fake <br>
        I'd like a stinking aching shake  /  I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavors <br>
        Gotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know  /  The vertigo is gonna grow <br>
        'Cause it's so dangerous, you'll have to sign a waiver <br>
        How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?  <br>
        Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad  /  I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral <br>
        Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will  /  I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve <br>
        I have a history of taking off my shirt  /  It's been one week since you looked at me <br>
        Threw your arms in the air and said, "You're crazy"  /  Five days since you tackled me <br>
        I've still got the rug burns on both my knees  /  It's been three days since the afternoon <br>
        You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon  /  Yesterday, you'd forgiven me <br>
        And now I sit back and wait 'til you say you're sorry  /  Chickity China, the Chinese chicken <br>
        You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'  /  Watching X-Files with no lights on <br>
        We're dans la maison  /  I hope the Smoking Man's in this one <br>
        Like Harrison Ford, I'm getting frantic  /  Like Sting, I'm tantric  /  Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy <br>
        Like Kurosawa, I make mad films, 'kay, I don't make films  /  But if I did they'd have a Samurai <br>
        Gonna get a set of better clubs  /  Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs <br>
        Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing  /  Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon <br>
        'Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes  /  That make me think the wrong thing <br>
        How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad? <br>
        Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad <br>
        I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral  /  Can't understand what I mean? You soon will <br>
        I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve  /  I have a history of losing my shirt <br>
        It's been one week since you looked at me  /  Dropped your arms to the sides and said, "I'm sorry" <br>
        Five days since I laughed at you and said  /  "You just did just what I thought you were gonna do" <br>
        Three days since the living room  /  We realized we're both to blame but what could we do? <br>
        Yesterday, you just smiled at me  /  'Cause it'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry <br>
        It'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry  /  It'll still be two days 'til we say, "Wasabi" <br>

        Current Song Neil Young - Ohio <br> <br>
        Tin soldiers and Nixon coming  /  We're finally on our own <br>
        This summer, I hear the drumming  /  Four dead in Ohio <br>
        Gotta get down to it  /  Soldiers are cutting us down <br>
        Should have been done long ago  /  What if you knew her <br>
        And found her dead on the ground  /  How can you run when you know? <br>
        Na na na na  /  Na na na na  /  Na na na na  /  Na na na  /  Na na na na  /  Na na na na  /  Na na na na <br>

        Four dead in Ohio  /  Four dead in Ohio (four)  /  Four dead in Ohio (four)  /  Four dead in Ohio <br>
